The premise of this application is that you already have an old, Web Forms Forms Authentication application setup,
so you shouldn't need to create a new db.  You can just use your existing db.
No changes are made to your db by this application. However, if you want to create a test aspnetdb, please
follow these steps:
*1. To configure your Sql Server edition for Forms Authentication, you need to run the Sql Server Registration Tool 
located at %WINDIR%\Microsoft.Net\Framework\<.net version>\aspnet_regsql.exe -W
The "-W" flag causes the command prompt to launch a wizard which will allow you to 
select the Sql Server and the database name.  
For this project, I selected aspnetdb_test.
*2. Add roles and users to the Forms Authentication db.  I did this manually, which, I know, is a pain.  
I will generate a script at a later point.
